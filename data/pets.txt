				`As you pull alongside the Subsidurial, you notice several blast marks along its body. It looks like someone was either hunting it, or using it as target practice.`
				`	"It looks tired and worn down, captain," Maribelle expresses concernedly. "Perhaps we could bring some asteroids over to feed it?"`
				`	After some coaxing, you manage to get the Subsidurial to settle among a nook of the Apoxys, and ferry it around the system, feeding it asteroids. Its energy comes back after a while, and it moves around the ship, occasionally brushing and nuzzling against parts of the hull."`
				`	"Aww, it looks like we have a friend!" Maribelle giggles. "What a sweetheart!"`
