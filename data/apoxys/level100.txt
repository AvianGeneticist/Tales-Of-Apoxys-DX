			`As you land on New Boston, near the factory, Maribelle looks at you. "Captain, I think... Once I go into the factory, I won't come out the same. I don't know what will happen to all our equipment, either," She says. "You should probably uninstall everything you can; buy some cheap replacement outfits here on New Boston, if you have to."`
			`	"What makes you say that?" You ask.`
			`	"I don't know, just a bad feeling in my engines," Maribelle expresses. "Please take the time to strip everything you can off of the ship."`

			`As you carefully fly the ship into the factory, Claire greets you on the monitor. "This is it, 'ey folks?" She asks.`
			`	"We're ready," Maribelle says.`
			`	"Loud and clear," Claire says. "This'll take a while. Hope you aren't gonna miss anything."`

			`The procedure feels like it takes hours; with the factory dark, you can't easily tell what's happening. The occasional flashes of grinding machinery or welding equipment don't illuminate anything well enough, but you can hear the sounds of labor echoing through the ship's hull. It's an eerie experience, sitting alone in the cockpit; the Apoxys has never needed a large crew, but you always at least had Maribelle to keep you company. Now, however, you are alone, all screens and holographic projectors left dark as you sit here in silence. To some, the distant sounds of machinery would be comforting; right now, however, you briefly wonder if you'll exit the factory alive or not.`
			`	Finally, the lights come back on; first in the factory, then in the ship. Maribelle soon materializes before you. She looks a bit dazed and confused. She looks at you slowly. "I think it's done, captain," Maribelle says.`
			`	Surprisingly, Claire materializes on the bridge as well. Guess that was one of the presumably many upgrades. "Hold on just a moment, you two. You've still got a bit of setup to do; you know how it is, gettin' comfy in yer own skin. There's always growin' pains," Claire says.`
			`	"What do we need to do?" Maribelle asks.`
			`	"Make sure the Apoxys is yer flagship, take off, and land somewhere. Ye've got a hundred upgrades yer new body's waitin' to spend," Claire says, looking at Maribelle.`
			`	Maribelle blinks. "Is it safe to do a hundred upgrades all at once?" She asks.`
			`	"Well, no. Ah, but- All your base upgrades are already included here. You just gotta pick out the stuff you'd normally pick out, Cap'n," Claire explains.`
			`	"Ohhh... Okay. That makes it easier, at least. I guess we'll have to do special upgrades again, too," Maribelle ponders.`
			`	"That's right. Don't go forgettin', now," Claire chides. "Ye'd look awful silly runnin' into some big bads and consequently gettin' yer hull handed t'ya because ya forgot yer upgrades."`
