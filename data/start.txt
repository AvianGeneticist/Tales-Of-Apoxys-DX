		description "The Apoxys is a large warship of unknown origin, quite weak by most standards, but with the curious ability to grow and evolve as it experiences the galaxy. The ship is helmed not only by a human crew, but a powerful AI, known only as Maribelle; it's believed that, at one point, the Apoxys was a completely autonomous war machine, but for one reason or another, it has since been turned into a human-crewed vessel."




conversation "toa intro"
	`New Boston is described in many places as "out in the hicks". So, it's not surprise to you that sometimes people come and conduct experiments they don't want going too public too fast around here. You've lived here for most of your life; your parents were fairly wealthy (for native New Bostoners, anyhow), so you've largely been able to spend most of your life in lower-middle class contentment.`
	`	You didn't know what you were expecting when you went warehouse surfing, but this wasn't it: A sleek, black bactrian, fins painted a pirate red. Its matte black finish dully reflects the light coming through the crack of the warehouse doors, and you quickkly pull the door behind you shut.`
	`	The ships' airlocks are open, surprisingly, and you manage to sneak in calmly. You'd need a number of crew to run a ship as big as this... Luckily, you have a fair-sized "posse". Your focus is broken, however, by a confused female voice.`
	`	"Hello?" The voice asks, "Is someone there? It's very nice to meet you... I don't bite! I think, anyways," They call. Your voice catches briefly, but you manage to work out an anxious, "Friendly! Friendly..."`
	`	Your nerves slightly subside as the ship's internal lights kick on, illuminating a surprisingly well-kept interior. A bit dusty, perhaps, but is there anything not dusty nowadays? "Are you my new captain?" The voice asks, "They told me I'd be found by a new captain, and that I'd get to see the endless sky we live in.`
	`	Out of a desire to not irk the ship's AI, you nod fervently, as if it can see you, "Yes," You reply, "I've come to check for how many crew you need, so I can go gather up a crew to pilot you," You promise. The voice turns to a more cheerful tone. "Oh, joyous day! I've longed to meet my pilot! What is your name, pilot? I'm Maribelle," The voice expresses.`
	name
	`	"...<first> <last>... What a wonderful name," The ship's AI says, "Well, Captain <last>, I hope to be of the greatest service to you! I've waited my whole life to finally see the stars and grow amongst them... Please do pardon my excitement." Maribelle explains. "I was designed to be customized to a captain's whim. Would you be opposed to giving some input on some featuresets?"`
	`	"What kind of featuresets?" You ask.`
	`	"At the moment, my body is relatively unspecialized. However, I was left with several sets of pre-designed modules to customize my operational capacity. I'm not, however, permitted to engage them myself," She explains.`
	`	Several options pop up on the console in front of you. Looks like she wasn't really asking.`
