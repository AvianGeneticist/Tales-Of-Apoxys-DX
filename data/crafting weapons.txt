	description "The Starcutter Beam is an extremely powerful beam weapon made by Claire. While not the flashiest weapon, or the longest-ranged, it can cut through both shield and hull with frightening speed and accuracy."

	description "This is a dual-turret variation of the Starcutter Beam. The amount of damage on offer is terrifying, though this comes at the cost of substantial space and support system requirements, and somewhat lackluster range."

	description "A large weapon made by Claire. While its damage is somewhat unimpressive for its size, its debilitating combo of ionization, slowing, scrambling, and shield disruption makes it a terrifying weapon to go up against."

	description "A weapon made by Claire. This puts a pair of Thorax Cannons on one mount and tweaks their firing cycles to fire bursts of five shots (alternating which cannon fires three shots each burst). The hit force per shot and accuracy seem to be inferior, but this comes as little consolation to those being shot at by the weapon."
