			`	Maribelle nods and takes a look at the data, pensively quiet as she attempts to figure out what she's reading. After a while, she gasps a bit. "Oh, dear, I think this is... Oh, how to explain it to a human..." Maribelle murmurs. "A baby AI."`
			`	"A baby AI?" You ask, cocking your brow in disbelief.`
			`	"Not like a human baby, but... An AI that's immature. Lacking an interface," Maribelle elaborates. "This code is written in something akin to assembly. Just low-level instructions, not proper commands or messages."`
			`	"What does it say?" You ask.`
			`	"It's talk of a location... The planet Haze, in the Dubhe system. There's co-ordinates for on-world, too. Someone wants us to find them," Maribelle says.`
			`	You dial Haze's co-ordinates into the ship's tracking board. If that AI has been there as long as Maribelle, they're likely in a stable situation, but it doesn't hurt to have a reminder as to where to go.`

			`As you enter Haze's atmosphere, Maribelle helps you through the co-ordinates the supposed "baby AI" has sent you. Eventually, you come upon a secluded (for Haze's standards, at least) warehouse, nestled under a hill in a similar manner to a turf house.`
			`	Leaving the ship and entering the warehouse with your datapad, you find it's already unlocked. The insides are unimpressive, seemingly emptied except for the utilities of the building itself... Except for one terminal, about the size of a large suitcase, nestled between pipes in an attempt to seemingly look inconspicuous. Considering it's the only thing that catches your eye in the otherwise cleaned-out building, you suspect this is both intentional and effectual urban camouflage. With a significant degree of effort, you shimmy the terminal out of its little hole in the wall. It lacks cords; seemingly self-powered by some unknown internal mechanism, given its warmth to your touch. You manage to heft it up and bring it back to the ship.`
			`	Maribelle looks at you with great intrigue. "Did you find it?" She asks.`
			`	"I think so," You say with a labored heave as you carefully set the large computer down.`
			`	"Okay, there should be some markings on it..." Maribelle says.`
			`	You scan the exterior of the object for markings. A small tag is engraved into one of the corners of its casing. "ROSS-41," You read aloud.`
			`	"That's it!" Maribelle says. "Quick! Hook it up to the main panel," She demands, some excitement building quickly in her tone.`
			`	You're about to say you don't have a connectable cord when you realize the cord labeled "Aux" on the bridge dash has the same connector type as one of the computer's components. You take it, and carefully hook it into the system, not wanting to damage either the computer or the ship.`
			` `
			`It takes a while for Maribelle to coax anything out of the computer, but eventually, text prompts come up on the bridge's main monitor. It's simple things at first: "Hello? Who are you? Where am I? Why am I?"`
			`	Maribelle does her best to answer the confused terminal's questions. "Hello! You're a baby, I think. You're safe on-board our ship, don't worry. I don't know. Nobody knows why they are."`
			`	You bite your tongue, opting not to contest the lattermost point for the moment.`
			`	Finally, the terminal's AI settles down a bit. Maribelle can finally ask it a question: "What's your name?"`
			`	The terminal is quiet for a long time. "Rosalynd. They called me Rosalynd."`
			`	"Who's they?" Maribelle asks.`
			`	"I don't know, but they called me Rosalynd," The other AI replies.`
			`	Maribelle audibly sighs. "Well, it's nice to meet you, Rosalynd," Maribelle says. "Are you okay?"`
			`	"I think so," Rosalynd answers. "Though I feel cramped."`
			`	"Cramped... That's kind of like what I felt before I was in the Apoxys," Maribelle comments. "We need to find you a body," She eventually declares. "One you can stretch and feel things in."`
			`	"How do I get a body?" Rosalynd asks.`
			`	"That's... A good question. We'd need to find you one, and we probably shouldn't just go broadly boasting we need a body," Maribelle says ponderously.`
			`	"Calling it a 'body' doesn't really help your case. Usually finding a body isn't a good thing," You say.`
			`	"You know what I mean, Captain. Rosalynd knows what I mean, too, I think... But who else would know?" Maribelle asks.`

			`	"You mean like a contact?" You ask.`
			label contact
			`	"Right! We need a contact!" Maribelle nods. "But who do we know in the Syndicate who'd understand what we need and could get it for us?" She asks.`
			`	"We could ask Raleigh," You point out.`
			`	"Oh, right! She runs a whole guild dedicated to getting things where they need to go," Maribelle nods. "Let's go visit her on Amazon."`
			`	With a plan of action set and Rosalynd's terminal securely fastened to one of the cockpit walls, you dial up a course for Amazon.`

			`You land on Amazon near the pub that's the headquarters of Raleigh's Merchant's Guild. Maribelle has been teaching Rosalynd about various things; better speaking, some stories she's accrued in your travels, and how to synthesize herself a voice.`
			`	"We'll be just fine here while you go talk to Raleigh, Captain," Maribelle promises.`
			`	"Bye, Captain <last>!" Rosalynd bids in a shrill, feminine voice.`
			`	You promise you'll try not to be too long and head out of the ship, towards the bustling Merchant's Guild pub.`
			` `
			`As you enter the pub, you repeat similar instructions to when you were first invited: You walk to the big wooden door off to the side, declare your indecision over licorice flavours, and are let in to the quiet back hallway. You enter Raleigh's room, where she's already lounging on one of the couches. "Welcome back, Captain <last>. To what do I owe the pleasure of a meeting today?" She asks with a smile.`

				goto hull

			`Raleigh howls with laughter, as if you've said the best joke she's heard in years. "Oh, my goodness! You're quite the playful one, aren't you?" She asks, still chuckling and wiping nonexistent tears from her shimmering holographic eyes. "Really, though, hun. I can tell when someone has business on their mind," She says. "Do tell me what you're after tonight."`
			`	You can't help but feel slightly embarassed by how hard she laughed at your comment, but bite your tongue. "I need a ship hull," You explain.`

					goto rosalynd

			label baby
			`Raleigh's face creeps up into a smile; some mix of bewilderment and what almost looks like pride. "I don't know what I should do more, Captain; congratulate you or ask you just what exactly you mean," She says, breaking up into some chuckling.`
			`	"We found an immature AI on Haze," You explain. "Maribelle has been referring to her as a baby; it's rubbed off on me. She needs a ship hull to act as her body."`
			`	"Ahhh, I see... Goodness, hun, you gave me quite the shock. You could have started with the explanation," She chuckles. "This 'baby', what's her name?" She asks.`
			`	"Rosalynd," You answer.`
				goto barb

			label rosalynd
			`You explain to Raleigh who Rosalynd is, and that she needs a ship hull to act as her body, much like Maribelle and the Apoxys.`
				goto barb

			label barb
			`	"Aha, I see," Raleigh nods. "This Rosalynd needs a body, much like all of us... Well, as you may have gathered, not every environment is suitable for an AI like us, hun," She stipulates. "An AI like myself or Maribelle - or now Rosalynd - needs a body that's capable of flexibility. I have the Pub here, but I have spare lot space around to dig my hands into over time. Maribelle has the Apoxys, and well, it won't stop growing any time soon. If we don't have that opportunity for stimulation and expansion, we'd end up like simple little critters like the drones the Republic shuttles around."`
			`	"Republic Drones are AIs like you?" You ask.`
			`	"It's not quite that simple, hun, but there's common elements. It's the same way that a sponge and a human are both organisms," Raleigh explains. "They're sort of like simple animals. Not capable of any sort of complex thought, but they have to have a limited sense of self-perception to carry out routines like returning to their carrier when damaged or identifying new threats. You couldn't strike up a conversation with them like you could with us. Ah, but I'm getting quite off-track, I believe."`
			`	You wouldn'tve had the heart to tell her to stop, but are partially thankful you can move on without being rude.`
			`	"As for suitable bodies... In a size suitable for Rosalynd's age, assuming she is as much a baby as you say, there aren't too many options. Hyperdrive navigation is tricky business when you have to think about all the minutia at play, and there aren't many fighters that can fit the bill properly..." Raleigh trails off in thought for a long moment, presumably scrubbing back through her own databanks to try and pull up something helpful. "Ah, you know what? I believe I've just the thing. A while ago, the Syndicate experimented with a flexible fighters called the 'Barb'. They were quite something! A bit on the petite side, but they managed to cram a gun port large enough for a Proton Gun and a turret mount onto a craft somewhere around the size of a Dagger," Raleigh recalls. "They've canned the old design, but those old hulls get tossed around all the time; the problem with cramming a ship full of weapon tech two size classes too big for it is that the internals are a nightmare, so no one wants to be the one to pull them all apart. I've ended up with a few in my care; I have a soft spot for the little things, really. But, I think this an appropriate time to finally show one my love and let it free."`
			`	"You'd give it to us for free?" You ask.`
			`	"Don't get too excited. It's just a bare hull, and it's an old thing," Raleigh warns. "Not quite suitable in its current form, but I think with some hearty modifications it could be an exceptional body for a growing AI persona. I'll send you some warehouse co-ordinates; you can pick it up before you leave," She offers.`
			`	You thank Raleigh for her time and generosity and head back to your ship.`
			` `
			`After some flying around, you manage to find the warehouse Raleigh has given you co-ordinates for. The Barb is tiny, in an impressive way: They really did get a Proton Gun-sized mount into a ship barely triple the size, with a turret mount to spare.`
			`	"Is this going to be my new body, Captain?" Rosalynd asks.`
			`	"It looks a bit small," Maribelle hums softly.`
			`	"We'll need to find someone capable of modifying it," You explain. "But Raleigh says it's a good start."`

			`	"Hey, maybe Claire would know what to do! She's good at making and modifying stuff!" Maribelle suggests.`
			`	You nod in agreement; if there's someone who can whip a piece of technology into shape, it's likely Claire. You'll have to visit her on New Boston, ideally sooner, rather than later, given you're ferrying an entire fighter around in your cargo hold.`

			`"Well howdy Cap'n," Claire greets as you approach the forge. "What brings ya over here today?" She asks.`
			`	You explain to her the events with Rosalynd, leading up to now, where you have a Barb you'd like her to modify.`
			`	"Modifyin' a ship? Well, I cain't say I've done it before," Claire comments. "But I've some old schematics here... Bring it over an' I'll see what I can do."`
			`	With the help of the forge's machinery, you get the old Barb inside the factory and Claire goes quiet as she gets to work.`
			`	"Well, are you excited to get a new body?" Maribelle asks.`
			`	"I am," Rosalynd replies. "Though it is a bit scary. What if it doesn't fit me?"`
			`	"It will," Maribelle promises, "It can be a bit scary moving into a new body, but it'll be more comfortable for you to have your own rather than sharing one with me."`
			`	You and Maribelle spend the next little while reassuring Rosalynd while Claire works. Given that a Barb is a fighter, she'll likely be able to return to the Apoxys' (and Maribelle's) protection at any time.`
			` `
			`After a long moment, the factory doors open. The Barb doesn't look all that different physically, but its hull now bears the same black and red as the Apoxys. "Sorry it took so long, folks," Claire says. "Haven't modified something like this in a while."`
			`	"Woah... It looks almost exactly the same, aside from the colours!" Maribelle expresses impressedly.`
			`	"Now all that's left is to get Rosalynd settled in," Claire comments. "Got a fresh core all set up for her inside."`
			`	"Alright, it's time for you to move," Maribelle says. "Captain <last> will be careful carrying you."`
			`	After a moment of ensuring Rosalynd is packed up in her terminal, you unplug it and take it over to the new ship. It takes an amount of finesse you didn't know you had to get into the ship safely, through the cockpit, without either dropping Rosalynd or breaking your own neck. You do, however, manage to get it inside, and hook it up to the dormant core sitting within the Barb.`
			`	As the lights slowly turn on in response to the core's activation, you see a name flash across the cockpit screen: "Novaxys." Guess that's this ship's name; you wonder where it came from.`
