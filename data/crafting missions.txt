			`Maribelle looks surprised as she perks up abruptly during what should be a fairly normal landing sequence. It takes her some time to speak, holding an indecipherable card in her holographic hand. "Captain, I've just received a message from someone calling themselves 'Claire'," Maribelle says, offering you the card.`
			`	You try very hard to read it, but it's nothing but flashy lights. "Could you read it to me?" You ask.`
			`	"Oh! It says we're sisters, or something like that... She runs a forge on New Boston. If you don't mind, I'd like to go investigate. I don't know if anything would come of it, but it can't hurt to look," Maribelle expresses to you.`

			`As you enter New Boston, Maribelle directs you away from the usual spaceport, instead sending you coasting over the horizon for roughly an hour. Eventually, however, you find what looks to be a very large, but otherwise inconspicuous factory complex. You can't even tell there's anything unusual about it, until a new voice comes through your ship's speakers.`
			`	"Can ya both hear me?" Asks a gruffer-sounding female AI, "I've been trying to contact y'all for a while."`
			`	"Loud and clear!" Maribelle answers before you can, "Sorry for the wait! Who's idea was it to make space so big, huh?"`
			`	This gets a laugh out of the other AI. "We'll find 'em eventually. Oh- but, here I am gettin' distracted. I'll welcome y'all in on the main landin' pad," They say.`
			``
			`As you touch down near the front of the factory, the door opens up to reveal a staggeringly large, seemingly automated workspace. Like the Apoxys, it looks some degree larger inside than it does outside.`
			`	A chubbier, older-looking hologram waves at you as you enter the ship. "So, you're the cap'n?" She asks, "I'm Claire. I'd shake yer hand but I'm afraid I can't do much of firm anything."`
			choice
				`	"It's nice to meet you, I'm Captain <last>."`
				`	"You're the operator of this forge, I assume?"`
					goto business

			`	"Nice to meet you, Cap'n. I think you'll like the sorts of surprises I have in store," Claire says.`
			`	"What sorts of things do you do here?" You ask.`
			label business
			`	"Straight to the point, eh? I like that; never was much for lollygaggin'," Claire chuckles, "I'm a blacksmith; whatever that implies in this age o' technology. Bring me the right things and I can make some tweaks to yer kit; make it easier to fit all your heart desires. 'Specially weapons; I'm always fancyin' a tinker with somethin' big 'n' boisterous," She explains.`
			`	"What sort of things can you make?" You ask.`
			`	"Well, that's kinda the tricky part... My databanks are locked down for the most part. Recently, though, a couple of 'em opened up for me. Simple stuff; bring me a Quantum Keystone and a Jump Drive, and I'll save you the dead space of having a hunk of rock crammed in a corner somewhere. There's other recipes too; I'll know 'em when I see 'em, but I gotta have faces to put names to, I reckon."`
			`	"Finding a Jump Drive and a Quantum Keystone shouldn't be too hard," You agree. "I'll come back once I find them."`
			`	"Sounds great, cap'n," Claire nods.`
			``
			`"Might get a bit tedious for you to scour the spaceport looking for the right terminal to get in touch with me, so I'll tell you what, Cap'n: I'll post open bills on the job board just for you when you're on-world; keep an eye out for jobs tagged 'crafting' an' you'll know that's me. Sound good?" Claire asks.`
			`	"Seems simple enough," You nod, "I'll be sure to check the job board when I think I've found something interesting."`
			`	"Great. Speakin' of, I've got a spare forge open. If you want me to craft up some components for you, I'll leave a bill on the board," Claire says.`
			`	"Components?" You ask, "What sorts of components?"`
			`	"Well, I can't do everythin' for ya, but I can cover the basics. Links for puttin' multiple guns on one mounts, and turret mounts good fer up to 120 tons. I'll need credits and time for the parts 'n' labor, though," Claire says.`

			`"'Ey, don't mention it, Cap'n," Claire says, "I got a job to do an' I love doin' it. I've been custom-makin' parts for folks as long as I can remember," Claire smiles at you. "You bring me back some interestin' stuff to tinker with, now," She requests, waving you off.`
				goto end

			label maribelle
			`"Well Cap'n, I ain't too perfectly sure of that m'self," Claire replies, scratching her head a bit. "Some kinda, I dunno. Sisterly intuition. Ain't ever met her before, but she just felt so darn familiar," She attempts to explain.`
			`	"Perhaps you knew each other before some kind of data wipe," You posit, finding it slightly suspicious that both Claire and Maribelle have databanks that are or were locked to them in certain peculiar ways.`
			`	"Your guess is as good as mine, Cap'n," Claire nods. "But, I oughtta get back ta runnin' the forge. You find me somethin' interestin' to tinker with, now," She requests.`

			label end
			`	You nod and return to your ship. What sort of things can she make? She mentioned fusing a Jump Drive and a Quantum Keystone in particular...`
			`	Maribelle greets you. "Well, how'd it go?" She asks excitedly.`
			`	"She's a crafter. If we bring her the right combinations of things, she can make better outfits and weapons for us," You explain.`
			`	"Oh, very nice! I bet we'll be seeing her a lot!" Maribelle giggles, clapping her hands together excitedly.`
